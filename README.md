# Classification-Problem
This dataset given for assignmentis a  classification model for predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The dataset contains several features related to the tumor's characteristics, and the target variable is binary (0 for benign, 1 for malignant). In this project, five popular classification algorithms are applied: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). Each algorithm is implemented and evaluated using standard preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values (if any) and feature scaling (standardization).

The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric, and the results are compared to identify the best-performing algorithm. This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques for real-world binary classification problems, showcasing different machine learning models' strengths and limitations. The goal is to identify the most accurate classifier for predicting breast cancer outcomes and understanding how different models behave with the dataset.
